## Requirements
* PHP 5.4+
* BCMath module

Optional:
* PHPUnit (*for testing*)

## Features
* Simple interest calculator
* Simple discount calculator
* Annuity present and future value calculator
* Debt amortization calculator
* Bond fair value calculator
* Bond Yield-to-Maturity (YTM) calculator
* Bond duration calculator
* Dividend Discount Model (DDM) calculator
* Investment ratios calculator for stocks/shares

Much more to come – including calculators for discount securities *(NOTE: can now be calculated with help of the simple discount calculator)*, ~~bond valuation~~, ~~duration~~, ~~stock pricing~~...
Also looking into other optimizations and improvements. Current hot ideas:
* ~~utilization of reflection in the getters of the calculators' result array for easier and less error-prone implementation of new calculator classes~~ (this has already been tackled by the means of utilizing a helper array of property names)
* ~~time functions for determining the exact dates of events pertaining to calculated instruments~~ (implemented via a TimeSpan object and appropriate getter methods in applicable classes)
* ability to create unpopulated calculator objects (which can then be populated via setters), obviating the need to pass in all the data via constructor and thus providing more flexibility
* support for various day count conventions (this has been in consideration from the jump but it has not been implemented yet)
* better modularity with a straightforward and easy-to-understand workflow (~ a plugin system)
* deserializers (as a part of an I/O package)
* avoid perpetual usage of reflection by means of caching

>**Please bear in mind that this is an ALPHA version containing incomplete features. The codebase is prone to drastic changes during its way out of the alpha stage.**

## Learning the ropes

### Place the library files into your directory structure

Just copy all the files somewhere appropriate, like a dedicated "*vendor*" or "*lib*" directory (so that it doesn't make a mess out of your directory hierarchy). Nothing more is needed.

Alternatively, you can obtain the library as a package via Composer. It's hosted on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/uruba/financalc)

### Include it in your project

The initialization is dead simple. Just include the **init.php** file in the main directory and you are good to go!

```php
// replace the example Composer-bound path with yours
require_once 'vendor/uruba/financalc/init.php';
```

Or, if you are using Composer, you can use its `autoload.php` file instead.

```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

### Instantiation

You have two choices as to how to instantiate the appropriate class to get your results:

#### Factory methods

Since the library automatically keeps track of pre-defined factory methods (contained in the classes which are members of the namespace *FinanCalc\Calculators\Factories*), it's very easy and straightforward to utilize them.

From the main *FinanCalc* object (whose instance you get by calling its static method *getInstance()*) you have to call the *getFactory()* method, which takes in the name of the factory class as a parameter of type *string* (you can find all the included factory classes in the *src/calculators/factories* directory).

This method yields you the final calculator object on which you can call the appropriate methods to retrieve your results (as described in the next chapter) or change the input parameters via its setters.

```php
use FinanCalc\FinanCalc;

...

$annuityCalculatorFactory = FinanCalc
    ::getInstance()
    ->getFactory('DebtAmortizatorFactory')
    ->newYearlyDebtAmortization(
        40000,
        6,
        0.12);
```

#### Direct instantiation

The second option is to instantiate the calculator class of your choice directly by calling its constructor with appropriate parameters (you can find all the included calculator classes in the *src/calculators* directory).

```php
use FinanCalc\Calculators\DebtAmortizator;
use FinanCalc\Utils\Time\TimeUtils;

...

$annuityCalculatorDirect = new DebtAmortizator(
                                       40000,
                                       6,
                                       TimeSpan::asDuration(1),
                                       0.12);
```

### Getting results

There are three ways to retrieve raw results of your calculations:

#### Directly accessible result object

It's very simple to retrieve the results just by calling the appropriate getter methods. ~~Every calculator class implementing the *CalculatorAbstract* has a getter method `getResult()`, which enables you to get an appropriate object representing the result of the calculation according to the data passed earlier to the constructor/factory method of a given calculator class~~ *(this intermediate step is unneeded since the version 0.3.0, please update your code by removing the calls of the getResult() method if you're upgrading from any of the earlier versions)*.

We'll demonstrate the process on our *AnnuityCalculator* – step by step, day by day:

1. step is to instantiate the appropriate calculator class, either by constructor or by a factory method (refer to the previous chapter for more information)

    ```php
    use FinanCalc\FinanCalc;
    
    ...
    
    // Instantiation by a factory method 
    // – 
    // in our case we calculate a yearly-compounded annuity
    // with a duration of 5 periods (here years),
    // 100000 money units paid out per period
    // and a compounding interest rate of 0.15 (i.e., 15%)
    $annuityCalculatorObject = FinanCalc
                                    ::getInstance()
                                    ->getFactory('AnnuityCalculatorFactory')
                                    ->newYearlyAnnuity(
                                        100000, 
                                        5, 
                                        0.15);
    ```

2. step is to get the desired value by exploiting the appropriate getter methods (for a detailed list of available gettter methods please refer to the **Reference** chapter)

    ```php
    // get the present value of the annuity in arrears
    // (as a string)
    $PV = $annuityCalculatorObject->getPresentValue(
                        new AnnuityPaymentTypes(AnnuityPaymentTypes::IN_ARREARS)
                    );
    // get the future value of the annuity in arrears
    // (as a string)
    $FV = $annuityCalculatorObject->getFutureValue(
                        new AnnuityPaymentTypes(AnnuityPaymentTypes::IN_ARREARS)
                    );
    ```

Therewith the process is concluded and you can now use the obtained results in any way you see fit.

#### Serialized output

If you want to get the marshaled object representation of the result, you can utilize the built-in method `getSerializedResult(SerializerInterface $serializer)` which is implemented in the base abstract class, from which every calculator class inherits. You just have to pass a serializer object (i.e., any object of a class which implements the *SerializerInterface* interface) to it.

We'll again demonstrate the process on our venerable *AnnuityCalculator* using the *XMLSerializer*:

1. step is the same – instantiate the appropriate calculator class, either through the constructor or via a factory method (refer to the previous chapter for more information)

    ```php
    use FinanCalc\FinanCalc;
    use FinanCalc\Utils\Serializers\XMLSerializer;

    ...

    // Instantiation by a factory method
    // –
    // in our case we calculate a yearly-compounded annuity
    // with a duration of 5 periods (here years),
    // 100000 money units paid out per period
    // and a compounding interest rate of 0.15 (i.e., 15%)
    $annuityCalculatorObject = FinanCalc
                                    ::getInstance()
                                    ->getFactory('AnnuityCalculatorFactory')
                                    ->newYearlyAnnuity(
                                        100000,
                                        5,
                                        0.15);
    ```

2. step is to get the serialized result object

    ```php
    $result = $annuityCalculatorObject->getSerializedResult(new XMLSerializer());
    ```

3. now we have a comprehensive representation of the result object in the target format. In our example it looks like this:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <root>
      <annuitySinglePaymentAmount>100000</annuitySinglePaymentAmount>
      <annuityNoOfCompoundingPeriods>5</annuityNoOfCompoundingPeriods>
      <annuityInterest>0.15</annuityInterest>
      <annuityPeriodLength>
        <years>1.00000000</years>
        <months>12.00000000</months>
        <days>360.00000000</days>
      </annuityPeriodLength>
      <annuityPresentValue>
        <in_advance>385497.83</in_advance>
        <in_arrears>335215.53</in_arrears>
      </annuityPresentValue>
      <annuityFutureValue>
        <in_advance>775373.79</in_advance>
        <in_arrears>674238.12</in_arrears>
      </annuityFutureValue>
    </root>
    ```

NOTE: The name of the "root" element in the XML output can be customized by the config property `serializers_root_elem_name`. In the future, it will be automatically assigned according to the type of the result object.

You can easily create your own serializer classes by implementing the *SerializerInterface*. A minimal example of a serializer (in this particular demonstrative case with YAML-formatted output) is here – [FinanCalc-YAMLSerializer](https://github.com/uruba/FinanCalc-YAMLSerializer).

#### Array

You can also get a result's representation as an array. This representation is primarily used to pass the calculator object's properties to a serializer. The output should therefore be equivalent except for the semantic representation. It also enables you to easily implement your own serializer classes, which are then passed the array as their parameter.

Let's demonstrate the process for the last time on our *AnnuityCalculator*:

1. step is the same – instantiate the appropriate calculator class, either through the constructor or via a factory method (refer to the previous chapter for more information)

    ```php
    use FinanCalc\FinanCalc;

    ...

    // Instantiation by a factory method
    // –
    // in our case we calculate a yearly-compounded annuity
    // with a duration of 5 periods (here years),
    // 100000 money units paid out per period
    // and a compounding interest rate of 0.15 (i.e., 15%)
    $annuityCalculatorObject = FinanCalc
                                    ::getInstance()
                                    ->getFactory('AnnuityCalculatorFactory')
                                    ->newYearlyAnnuity(
                                        100000,
                                        5,
                                        0.15);
    ```

2. step is to get the result array

    ```php
    $result = $annuityCalculatorObject->getResultAsArray();
    ```

3. the result array will look like this (the "var_export" representation):

    ```php
    array (
      'annuitySinglePaymentAmount' => '100000',
      'annuityNoOfCompoundingPeriods' => '5',
      'annuityInterest' => '0.15',
      'annuityPeriodLength' =>
      array (
        'years' => '1.00000000',
        'months' => '12.00000000',
        'days' => '360.00000000',
      ),
      'annuityPresentValue' =>
      array (
        'in_advance' => '385497.83',
        'in_arrears' => '335215.53',
      ),
      'annuityFutureValue' =>
      array (
        'in_advance' => '775373.79',
        'in_arrears' => '674238.12',
      ),
    )
    ```

### Configuration

The configuration capabilities are currently very limited so there's next to nothing to tinker with.

The default configuration values are currently to be found in the "*constants/Defaults.php*" file, but there will be a possibility to use an easily accessible JSON (or PHP) configuration file in the future.

### Tests

The library includes a "*test*" subdirectory which contains all the basic tests. For your peace of mind, feel free to give them a run on your setup (provided that you have PHPUnit good and ready) and ensure that everything checks out.

The test-case examples are adapted directly from the lectures of a university course "*[4ST608 - Introduction to Financial and Insurance Mathematics](https://isis.vse.cz/katalog/syllabus.pl?predmet=62055;lang=en)*" taught at the University of Economics in Prague by Prof. RNDr. Tomáš Cipra, DrSc., to whom goes all the credit.

## Reference

Here you can find the documentation for each of the vanilla calculator types.

The implicit type of setters'/constructors' arguments as well as getters' returned values is String if not stated otherwise.

Time values are primarily represented by individual instances of `TimeSpan` class. Its concept is (roughly) similar to [a structure of the same (unqualified) name in .NET Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/system.timespan%28v=vs.110%29.aspx).

### [TimeSpan](src/Utils/Time/TimeSpan.php)
namespace `FinanCalc\Utils\Time`

To initialize the class, you should use one of its three static factory methods (the default constructor is declared as private and it is not advised to circumvent this measure).
* **asDuration($years, $months = 0, $days = 0)** – simple (rounded) time duration defined by numerical values of its time components
* **asDurationWithStartDate(DateTime $startDate, $years, $months = 0, $days = 0)** – simple (rounded) time duration defined by numerical values of its time components, keeping track of its starting date
* **asInterval(DateTime $startDate, DateTime $endDate)** – precise representation of a time duration specified by its starting and ending date

#### Setters
* **setStartDate(DateTime $startDate)** – sets or re-sets the starting date
* **setEndDate(DateTime $endDate)** – sets or re-sets the ending date
* **clearStartEndDate()** – sets both the starting and ending date to null

#### Getters
* **getStartDate()** – gets the starting date
* **getEndDate()** – gets the ending date
* **getYearsComponent()** – gets the "year" component of the underlying `DateInterval` object
* **getMonthsComponent()** – gets the "month" component of the underlying `DateInterval` object
* **getDaysComponent()** – gets the "day" component of the underlying `DateInterval` object
* **toYears()** – converts the entire time duration (i.e., accounting for all its components – year, month and day) to years
* **toMonths()** – converts the entire time duration (i.e., accounting for all its components – year, month and day) to months
* **toDays()** – converts the entire time duration (i.e., accounting for all its components – year, month and day) to days

* * *

If you ever need a convenient way to convert time units, feel free to make use of static methods of the `TimeUtils` class which is built for this purpose (it's also used internally within the library). It also takes into account the day count convention that's currently set in the library's configuration (i.e., the number of days in a year).

### [TimeUtils](src/Utils/Time/TimeUtils.php)
namespace `FinanCalc\Utils\Time`

#### Getters
* **getYearsFromDays($numberOfDays)** – converts the given number of days to years (taking into account the day count convention currently set in the configuration)
* **getYearsFromMonths($numberOfMonths)** – converts the given number of months to years
* **getYearsFromYears($numberOfYears)** – converts the given number of years to years (just a proxy method)
* **getMonthsFromDays($numberOfDays)** – converts the given number of days to months (taking into account the day count convention currently set in the configuration)
* **getMonthsFromMonths($numberOfMonths)** – converts the given number of months to months (just a proxy method)
* **getMonthsFromYears($numberOfYears)** – converts the given number of years to months
* **getDaysFromDays($numberOfDays)** – converts the given number of days to days (just a proxy method)
* **getDaysFromMonths($numberOfMonths)** – converts the given number of months to days (taking into account the day count convention currently set in the configuration)
* **getDaysFromYears($numberOfYears)** – converts the given number of years to days (taking into account the day count convention currently set in the configuration)
* **getCurrentDayCountConvention()** – gets the current day count convention
* **isDayCountConventionValid($dayCountConvention)** – checks whether a day count convention (passed in by the argument) is a valid day count convention
